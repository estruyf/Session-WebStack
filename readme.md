# Webstack demos

For the Socket.io / Tweets demo you need to create a `config.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
    "consumer_key": "",
    "consumer_secret": "",
    "token": "",
    "token_secret": ""
}
```

> Info: You will have to create a Twitter application for this in order to retrieve the tokens.
